# The release API consists of one method that pushes the repository container image to a Docker registry.
#
#   no flags          : release the image defined by the current repository node to the default Docker registry
#   --all             : release the images defined on the current repository node and all child nodes
#   --external        : release all images that require external access to build
#   --internal        : release all images which require no external access to build
#   --hub (last flag) : release image to Docker Hub.
